						<div class="persona-text">
							<h3>What Danny tells us:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									He needs to be able to picture himself in college.
								</li>
								<li>
									He needs an overview of the Program to be sure that it fits into his life as he knows it.
								</li>
								<li>
									He needs some Spanish language materials to “on board” his parents to the Program.

					<h2>Denise</h2>
					<div class="persona-grid">
						<div class="persona-image">
							<img src="lib/images/denise.jpg" />
						</div>
						<div class="persona-text">
							<h3>What Denise tells us:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									She may need to explain the Program to her parents herself so the information she gets should predict questions that they may have.								</li>
								</li>
								<li>
									She may also be filling out the applications herself or with minimal input from her parents.
								</li>
								<li>
									She would benefit from being able to find other scholars from her school and learn about their experience with the Program.

							<h3>What Luisa tells us:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									She needs accessible program information in Spanish.
								</li>
								<li>
									She needs to understand how the Schuler Scholar Program is going to help her and Rosie with the college application process.
								</li>
								<li>
									She needs to see where Schuler Scholars end up in college as “going away” to school is not a familiar concept to her.

					<h2>Dwight</h2>
					<div class="persona-grid">

						</div>
						<div class="persona-text">
							<h3>What Dwight tells us:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									He needs to understand clearly - in human terms, without educational jargon - the requirements of the Program and what the mission is.
								</li>
								<li>
									He may need to speak with someone directly and needs direct access to his most appropriate point of contact for questions.
								</li>
								<li>
									He needs to see other students like James and other parents like him, who have been a part of the “Schuler Family” to feel more comfortable.

					<h2>Heidi</h2>
					<div class="persona-grid">
						<div class="persona-image">
							<img src="lib/images/heidi.jpg" />
						</div>

						<div class="persona-text">
							<h3>What Heidi tells us:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									She needs to see how the Program distinguishes itself from other College Access Programs. In reality, this may be mostly aesthetic (a refreshed website that looks polished among its peers), but also should help her understand the how a student’s path through the Program compares to other programs.								</li>
								<li>
									She needs to see which other schools are partners in the Program and how many students have participated in the Program.								</li>
								<li>
									She needs information to take to her stakeholders (superintendent, school board, etc.)
								</li>
								<li>
									She needs to know who to contact.

						<div class="persona-text">
							<h3>What Tim tells us:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									He needs to see the benefits to him to becoming a Scholar Coach - the lines on his resume and the path it could create for him.
								<li>
									He needs an appeal to his strong sense of justice and making the world a better place, and a clear understanding of how his role at the Program can make a difference.
								<li>
									He wants to see other people like him working in similar roles in order to validate his choice to do this kind of work.

					<h2>Landscape Analysis</h2>
					<h3>To emulate:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Information archeticture and menu structure the delineates tasks
							</li>
							<li>
								Good use of video and/or large format imagery that captures the
								imagination of potential scholars
							</li>
							<li>
								Clear presentation of data and success stories both for
								potential scholars and future partners
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<div class="fragment">
					<h3>To stand out:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Wide spectrum of voices - high school through college, and
								beyond - can tell a story of broad and lasting impact
							<li>
								Partner message can be clearly separated from stakeholder
								message
							</li>
							<li>Full Spanish translation</li>

					<h2>Learnings from Stakeholders</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							The need to visualize those elements of the Program, which are difficult to put into words. Some examples of this include:
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							The need for a “Scholar First” approach with an emphasis on the success of the scholars individually over the success of the organization as a whole.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							The need to attract recent college graduates, who are job seekers to see the benefit of becoming part of the Schuler team.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							The need for less text and more image and graphical representation of the Program descriptions.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							The need for better organization of materials based on the type of person that is accessing the site
