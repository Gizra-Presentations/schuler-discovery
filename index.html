            descriptions. In some cases there will be multiple personas with the

						</div>
						<div class="persona-text">
							<p>
								Danny is in seventh grade in Gurnee, IL. He was born and raised
								in the Chicago area, his parents having emigrated from Honduras
								while his mother was pregnant. He is a good student, well-liked
								by his peers and his teachers.
							</p>

							<p>
								His social studies teacher told him that he should apply to the
								Schuler Scholar program and gave him some information along with
								the website address. He hasn’t really thought much about college
								yet, but assumes that he will go to college because that’s what
								most of his peers assume, even though no one in his family has
								attended college.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’s not sure what’s involved with this program, but he’s
								willing to learn more. He plays travel soccer and he wants to
								play for his high school, so he’s worried that those commitments
								may conflict with the requirements of the program.

					<h2>Denise</h2>
					<div class="persona-grid">
						<div class="persona-image">
							<img src="lib/images/denise.jpg" />
						</div>
						<div class="persona-text">
							<p>
								Denise is in seventh grade in the Garfield Park neighborhood of Chicago. She’s got good grades,did well on the MAP test, and hopes to go to Lindblom Academy, a CPS selective enrollment school. When she was visiting Lindblom, one of the guidance counselors told her about the Schuler Scholar program and she’s quite interested. She’s determined to go to an elite college and has been since she can remember.
							</p>

							<p>
								Denise’s mother went to college and works downtown as a secretary at a big accounting firm. Her father did not go to college and has changed careers multiple times in her life. At the moment, he drives a delivery truck for a food distributor.
							</p>

							<p>
								Denise wants to apply to the program, but her parents want more information and don’t have a lot of time to investigate on their own. Her older sister has some high school friends, who are in the program and she likes what she hears from them.

					<h2>Luisa</h2>
					<div class="persona-grid">
						<div class="persona-image">
							<img src="lib/images/luisa.jpg" />
						</div>
						<div class="persona-text">
							<p>
								Luisa is a mother of three from Niles, IL who emigrated from
								Mexico when her oldest child Rosie was two years old. She has
								picked up enough English in the past 10 years, since emigrating,
								to get by. But they speak Spanish at home and she relies on Rosie
								to translate important material for her.
							</p>

							<p>
								All she wants is for her children to go to college, but she has
								limited access to information, no familiarity with the college
								application process, and financial uncertainty around tuition
								costs. She heard about the Schuler Scholar program from a friend
								and wants to learn more about opportunities for Rosie.

					<h2>James</h2>
					<div class="persona-grid">
						<div class="persona-image">
							<img src="lib/images/john.jpg" />
						</div>
						<div class="persona-text">
							<p>
								James is a father of two from Waukegan, IL. He is of Polish descent, but he was born in Chicago and completed high school on Chicago’s northwest side. Immediately after high school, he started in the plumbing trade, where he has been for the past 15 years. College was not something he ever considered for himself, and not something he necessarily assumed his son John would pursue either.
							</p>

							<p>
								John has a teacher who thinks that he would be a good fit for the Schuler Scholar program, but James isn’t really sure about it. He doesn’t really understand why someone would want to pay for James to participate in such a program and believes there must be some kind of catch to it. This is really the first time James has considered the costs and logistics involved in John going to college.

					<h2>Heidi</h2>
					<div class="persona-grid">
						<div class="persona-image">
							<img src="lib/images/heidi.jpg" />
						</div>

						<div class="persona-text">
							<p>
								Heidi is a guidance counselor at a Chicago-area high school not affiliated with the Schuler Scholar program. She has a lot of students with potential, but some some of them lack the resources to fully realize their potential in the college application process. In particular, she has one student named Colleen who mentioned that she would likely attend College of Lake County because it was all her family could afford and seemed like it had the easiest application process.
							</p>

							<p>
								Heidi knows that Colleen has the talent and test scores to compete with students applying to elite colleges across the country, but she understands that all students can’t afford or manage the process. She knows about the Schuler Scholar program from her colleagues in the field and she would like to make a case to her administration to bring the program to her school.
